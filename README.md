# HangMan

Beginner C# console application implementing the classic Hangman word game.

This project was created as an early learning exercise while getting familiar with
C#, basic object-oriented programming, and console applications.

## About the project

The game selects a random word from a predefined word list.
The player guesses letters until the word is solved or the maximum number of attempts is reached.

The focus of this project was **learning fundamentals**, not building a complex or polished game.

## What I learned

- C# syntax and basic language constructs
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Basic object-oriented design
- Working with files (loading words from a text file)
- Structuring a small console application

## How to run

1. Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code
2. Build the solution
3. Run the console application
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play

## Notes

This is intentionally kept as a **beginner project**.
It represents an early stage in my learning journey and is published as such.

The project may be extended in the future, but for now it serves as a documented
starting point.
